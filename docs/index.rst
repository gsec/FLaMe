===============================
FLaMe - a FLake LAttice ModelEr
===============================
This is a simulation for crystal growth with combined HCP/FCC stacking written in python.
Supports different growth modes, arbitrary twinplanes and an interface for bulk simulation 
and statistics.
It started as my thesis but is not actively developed anymore. Nevertheless comments and
improvements are welcome under <o0v0o.ix@gmail.com>
