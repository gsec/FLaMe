Structural Concept of Experiments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Tiers
=====

Sample:
------
* Multiple runs of a growth process with the exact same parameters.
  `not relevant with **deterministic** growth`

Unit:
------
*   Series of sampling experiments where on parameter is continuously altered to make those
  effects visible.

Snapshot:
------
*   Current state of a Flake and the corresponding parameters.

  1. size; number of atoms

  2. twin planes

  3. seed; atom configuration at step 0

  4. temp

  5. etc...

Format
======

 each **unit** into own folder

 each **sample** into own file

 each **snapshot** into own line
